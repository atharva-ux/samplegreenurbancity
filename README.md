# Q. Why do I want to take part in this competition?
I want to protect my environment to my best ability. I am very much interested in computers, and I feel that this competition has a steep learning curve which I am willing to complete. I am willing to devote my time to the best of my ability as required. I am very much interested in working in groups in order to gain much more experience to further the chances of a good career. I am also looking forward to learn more about my environment from the point of view of the biology side.
